# Business Integrations on Github

Business Integrations Ltd is a web design and hosting company in the UK. We specialise in building elegant websites using CMS frameworks.
We started out using Kentico CMS, but are now favouring the open-source Orchard CMS. Using Orchard gives us full access to all functionality and the source code, and a CMS without the licensing restrictions that Kentico has, and also without paying large amounts of money for licenses for extra functionality.

On Github we will be publishing repos of Orchard CMS modules, both third-party ones that we use frequently that we have adapted or modified to our own ends, or that we've written ourselves.
