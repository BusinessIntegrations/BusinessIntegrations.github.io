# Site Essentials
We design and build web sites for clients using OrchardCMS which out-of-the-box doesn't come with some of the core functionality you'd generally expect from a CMS: Sitemaps, FavIcons, SEO etc etc.

Although there appear to be a lot of modules available for Orchard in the gallery, many are out of date, or don't work with the latest version (1.10.2), or are generally no longer supported. 
So, rather than starting from scratch, we took a bunch of third-party modules and reworked them where necessary. We use these modules in production websites, and we generally refer to them as our 'Site Essentials' - as they contain functionality we'd generally use in every website.
