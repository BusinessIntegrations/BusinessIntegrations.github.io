# Site Essentials
---
We design and build web sites for clients using OrchardCMS which out-of-the-box doesn't come with some of the core functionality you'd generally expect from a CMS: Sitemaps, FavIcons, SEO etc etc.

Although there appear to be a lot of modules available for Orchard in the gallery, many are out of date, or don't work with the latest version (1.10.2), or are generally no longer supported. 
So, rather than starting from scratch, we took a bunch of third-party modules and reworked them where necessary. We use these modules in production websites, and we generally refer to them as our 'Site Essentials' - as they contain functionality we'd generally use in every website.

## Modules
All of these modules have been forked and are our available on our main [organisation page](https://github.com/BusinessIntegrations), or from the links below. I've listed the functional changes/fixed we've made to each module.
